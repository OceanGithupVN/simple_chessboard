# simple_chessboard
Hello, it's Lê Xuân Lâm.
I'm trying to make a simple chess game that using C++ standard library, display the chessboard on a simple 2D text board!
I hope this game will improve my programing skill!
It's my first time working with github, pls tell me what i should do at: <update_later>
